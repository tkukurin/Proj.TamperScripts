# Chrome TamperMonkey scripts

Some scripts I wrote to simplify note-taking for video lectures & such.
Primarily adds shortcuts to websites.

* YouTube: Copy current timestamp and recent captions to clipboard.
* YouTube: Video speed control based on [igrigorik/videospeed](https://github.com/igrigorik/videospeed).
* GitHub: Shortcut to visit Sourcegraph or Colab for current page
* Twitter: Copy contents of entire current thread as plain text

`include.js` is a simple library; has shorthand methods for DOM manipulation,
shortcut definition, etc.
